"""Write a synthetic taxonomy CSV so the stack can be exercised without the real dataset.

The real artifact lives under `artifacts/`, which is gitignored, so a fresh
clone cannot seed species and every commerce flow fails on species resolution.
This regenerates a stand-in with the correct shape and the eleven supported
labels.

The values are NOT authoritative. Statuses come from the in-code
TAXONOMY_STATUS_BY_LABEL, the three scientific names the tests pin are correct,
and the rest are plausible names for those Indonesian common names that still
need expert verification. Every row is stamped `synthetic-dev-fixture` so a
generated row can never be mistaken for dataset provenance.

Usage: python -m scripts.make_synthetic_taxonomy [--force]
