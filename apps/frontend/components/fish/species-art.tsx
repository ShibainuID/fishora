/**
 * The catch photograph for a lot.
 *
 * A species we hold photography for shows that species. Anything else shows
 * open water, because putting some other fish next to an unrecognised label
 * misinforms a buyer deciding what to bid on, and ambient water claims nothing.
 *
 * The name is printed over the image either way, so the card is never relying
 * on the photograph alone to say what the lot is.
 *
 * The caller owns the box. className lands on the root, so a caller can pass
 * `absolute inset-0` or `aspect-[4/3] w-full` and either works; the root never
 * sets its own position, because a position utility here would beat the
 * caller's by stylesheet order and silently collapse the box to zero height.
