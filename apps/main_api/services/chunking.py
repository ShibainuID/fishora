"""Semantic chunking of approved knowledge records.

One candidate record is one semantic unit (species, source, category): it is
kept whole when at or below ``max_tokens`` even when far below ``min_tokens``
— short units are never merged to reach a target size. Longer content splits
on sentence boundaries; a single sentence above ``max_tokens`` is cut into
windows of at most ``max_tokens`` tokens with exactly one ``overlap_tokens``
overlap between consecutive windows, each window decoded independently so
partial tokens at the cut stay safe. Overlap is applied exactly once per
split: window units already carry their overlap and never receive an
additional carry, and multi-sentence chunks carry at most ``overlap_tokens``
tokens of the previous chunk. Every emitted chunk is re-encoded and asserted
to stay within ``max_tokens`` tokens. Encode/decode always run without
special tokens, so no [CLS]/[SEP]/<s>/</s> text can appear in chunks.
