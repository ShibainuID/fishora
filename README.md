# Fishora

Fishora is an AI catch-intelligence platform for Indonesian capture fisheries. A DINOv3 image
classifier identifies a landed fish, a human confirms or corrects it, and retrieval-augmented
generation turns the verified species into a grounded, source-cited commercial knowledge card in
Bahasa Indonesia.

The local runtime starts PostgreSQL in Docker and runs the CV service, the API and the web frontend
on the host. Only the database is containerised, so the CV service can reach a GPU directly when one
is available; it also runs on CPU at roughly a second per image, which is enough to demonstrate the
whole flow.

**Running this for the first time? Start with [Quick start](#quick-start).**

## Quick start

Everything below is copy-paste from the repository root. It assumes Python 3.11+, Node 20.9+ with
pnpm, and Docker. No GPU, no API key and no dataset are needed to get a working app.

**1. Pick the interpreter.** The venv layout differs by platform, so the rest of this guide uses
`$PY`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
PY=.venv/Scripts/python.exe   # Windows (Git Bash / MSYS)
PY=.venv/bin/python           # macOS and Linux
"$PY" -m pip install --upgrade pip
"$PY" -m pip install -e .
```

**2. Point at the database.** It has no default, and every command below needs it:

```bash
export FISHORA_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://fishora:fishora@localhost:55432/fishora
```

**3. Create the schema and seed something to click through.** `artifacts/` is gitignored, so a fresh
clone has no taxonomy and no lots; these scripts stand in for the real dataset:

```bash
docker compose up -d db
"$PY" -m alembic upgrade head
"$PY" -m scripts.make_synthetic_taxonomy
"$PY" -m scripts.seed_taxonomy
"$PY" -m scripts.seed_demo_lots --reset
```

**4. Start the API** (leave it running):

```bash
"$PY" -m uvicorn apps.main_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**5. Start the frontend** in a second terminal:

```bash
cd apps/frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev --port 3111
```

Open **http://localhost:3111**.

### Signing in

Go to `/account` and pick an account from the dropdown. Both use the password `demo`, which the form
fills for you:

| Account | Role | What it can do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rian Setiawan | Operator | Photograph a catch, confirm the species, publish a lot, close and allocate an auction, print the QR card |
| Dewi Anggraini | Buyer | Browse the marketplace, set a buyer profile, bid by the kilogram, review a species after winning |

### A five-minute tour

1. **`/`** the landing page: the scroll descent, then the flow, then what a QR card carries.
2. **`/marketplace`** as Dewi: eleven species with real catch photography, filters by species, price
   and volume.
3. **`/marketplace/demo_lot_1`**: the knowledge panel, the market-signal reviews, and a bid bar.
4. **`/preferences`**: set a buyer profile and watch the match count move before you save.
5. **`/operator`** as Rian: the four-step publish flow.
6. **`/operator/lots`** as Rian: close an auction, allocate it, then **Buat QR** for the printable
   3:4 card.
7. **`/discover/demo_tenggiri-l-1`**: the public page a shopper reaches by scanning that card. No
   auth, no commercial data.

### Optional: AI species identification

The classifier needs the model export and two extra packages. It runs on CPU.

First, download the model export. It is not tracked in git (see `ai/results/` in
`.gitignore`), so a fresh clone has no weights. Get the archive from the shared
Google Drive folder and unpack it into the `ai/` directory as follows:

```bash
# 1. Download the archive from the shared folder:
#    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PzeQ4AEnZdK48Nmq29az-2sImDiYubPk?usp=sharing
#    Save it as ai/fishora_export.zip (or whatever archive name the folder provides).

# 2. Extract it inside ai/ so the export lands at the default path:
cd ai
unzip fishora_export.zip
cd ..
```

The unpacked export must match the expected location
`ai/results/fishora_dinov3_large_frozen/export/` and contain `model_state_dict.pt`,
`inference_config.json` and `inference.py`. If the archive omits the
`results/fishora_dinov3_large_frozen/` part of the path, move the `export/` folder to
`ai/results/fishora_dinov3_large_frozen/` after extracting.

Then install the extra packages and start the CV service:

```bash
"$PY" -m pip install torch torchvision timm
FISHORA_CV_DEVICE=cpu "$PY" -m uvicorn apps.cv_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

With it running, `/operator` identifies a photograph instead of asking for the species. Note that the
shipped export has `abstain_threshold: 0.0`, so the API reports
`low_confidence_human_verification_required` for every prediction however high the score, and the
operator always confirms explicitly. That is the intended human-in-the-loop gate, not a fault.

### Optional: knowledge cards

Generated cards need three things, in this order:

1. `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` in `.env`.
2. The E5 weights in the local Hugging Face cache. The embedder is constructed with
   `local_files_only=True` so a request never triggers a download, which means fetching it once, on
   purpose:

```bash
"$PY" -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('intfloat/multilingual-e5-base')"
```

Miss any of those and the endpoint answers `502 knowledge retrieval is temporarily unavailable`.
Even with all three, cards come back empty with the limitation `Informasi belum tersedia` until an
approved corpus is ingested: generation is fail-closed and will not assert anything it cannot cite.
That approval requires a human attestation and is deliberately not automated.

## System at a Glance

| Service | Port | Runs on | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend (Next.js 16) | 3111 | Host, Node | Operator flow, marketplace, public QR profile |
| Main API (FastAPI) | 8000 | Host, Python | Identification, verification, knowledge cards |
| CV service (FastAPI) | 8001 | Host, Python + CUDA | DINOv3 species classification |
| PostgreSQL + pgvector | 55432 | Docker | Species, knowledge chunks and embeddings, predictions |

`scripts/run_local.sh` still defaults `FISHORA_FRONTEND_PORT` to 3000, but 3111 is the port used in
practice: 3000 is often taken by an unrelated app on this machine, and Playwright's `webServer` runs
`pnpm dev --port 3111` (`apps/frontend/playwright.config.ts`). The API's default CORS allow-list
covers both, so either port works from a browser without extra configuration.

The browser talks to the Main API directly, so two settings must agree or every request fails:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (where the frontend sends requests) and `FISHORA_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`
(which browser origins the API accepts). `scripts/run_local.sh` derives both from the port variables,
so changing a port keeps them in step automatically.

## API Surface

Identification and knowledge:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Liveness plus `taxonomy_seeded` |
| POST | `/api/v1/fish/identify` | Multipart image upload, returns a prediction and ranked candidates |
| POST | `/api/v1/fish/verify` | Human confirms or corrects the predicted species |
| POST | `/api/v1/fish/manual` | Operator declares the species themselves, used when the CV service is down |
| GET | `/api/v1/predictions/{id}/knowledge` | Grounded knowledge card for a **verified** prediction |

Commerce, buyers, and session:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/lots` | Publish a lot from a verified prediction. Optional `auction_hours` |
| GET | `/api/v1/lots` | Public list with filters. `mine=1` scopes it to the signed-in operator |
| GET | `/api/v1/lots/{id}` | One lot |
| POST | `/api/v1/lots/{id}/bids` | Place a bid (buyer session) |
| GET | `/api/v1/lots/{id}/bids` | Bid history for a lot |
| POST | `/api/v1/lots/{id}/close` | Listing operator closes the auction |
| POST | `/api/v1/lots/{id}/allocate` | Listing operator allocates to the winning bid |
| PUT | `/api/v1/buyers/{id}/preferences` | Buyer preference profile |
| GET | `/api/v1/buyers/{id}/recommendations` | Explainable matches for a buyer |
| GET | `/api/v1/discover/{public_slug}` | Public consumer profile from the publish-time snapshot |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/logout`, GET `/api/v1/auth/me` | Role-based demo session |

Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

`GET /health` returns `{"status": "ok", "taxonomy_seeded": bool}`. `taxonomy_seeded` is false when the
species table is empty, which is a distinct failure mode from the API being down: the API answers 200,
but every identification and manual declaration fails on species resolution.

`POST /api/v1/fish/manual` takes multipart `file` plus a `species_id` form field and creates a
verified prediction directly, so a CV outage cannot strand a catch. It records
`model_version="manual-entry"` and `confidence=0.0` so the audit trail never implies the model agreed.

A knowledge card is only issued for a verified prediction. Requesting one for a pending prediction
returns `409` by design: an AI guess must not become a public commercial record.

`auction_hours` on `POST /api/v1/lots` is optional and bounded by `MIN_AUCTION_HOURS` /
`MAX_AUCTION_HOURS` (1 to 72) in `apps/main_api/services/lots.py`. Omitting it keeps the 4h default.

## Prerequisites

Required:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js 20.9 or newer (22.x recommended) and pnpm 10
- Docker with Docker Compose

Optional, and only for AI species identification:

- A model export containing `model_state_dict.pt`, `inference_config.json` and `inference.py`. The
  default path is `ai/results/fishora_dinov3_large_frozen/export`. It is not in git, so download the
  archive from the shared Google Drive folder and unpack it into `ai/` — see
  [AI species identification](#ai-species-identification).
- An NVIDIA GPU with a CUDA driver. Not required: the classifier runs on CPU at about a second per
  image. Without the export at all, the operator names the species by hand, which is a designed path
  rather than a workaround, and nothing downstream is affected.

Optional, and only for generated knowledge cards:

- `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` in `.env`, plus the embedding model cached locally. See
  [Knowledge cards](#knowledge-cards).

## Setup

### 1. Python environment

Create one virtual environment and install CUDA-enabled PyTorch before installing Fishora:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv

# The venv layout differs by platform. Set this once and reuse it everywhere below.
PY=.venv/Scripts/python.exe   # Windows (Git Bash / MSYS)
PY=.venv/bin/python           # macOS and Linux

"$PY" -m pip install --upgrade pip
"$PY" -m pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
"$PY" -m pip install -e '.[cv,dev]'
```

`run_local.sh` detects either layout on its own, so the run command below is the same either way.

The torch line is only needed for the CV service. Skip it to run everything else; identification
then returns 503 and the operator picks the species by hand.

Verify that PyTorch can access the GPU:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))'
```

Cache the embedding model once while internet access is available. Runtime loading is offline-only.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c 'from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer("intfloat/multilingual-e5-base")'
```

### 2. Frontend dependencies

```bash
cd apps/frontend
pnpm install
cd ../..
```

### 3. Configuration

Defaults are ready for local use. Create `.env` only to override them or to supply an OpenCode Go
API key for generated knowledge cards:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` in `.env`. The researcher, four domain experts, critic and writer share
one OpenCode Go client configured with `FISHORA_OPENCODE_GO_MODEL=gpt-5.6-luna`. Without the key
everything still starts, and identification and verification work normally; only knowledge card
generation fails, with a `502`.

The key is not sufficient on its own. Retrieval runs before generation, so a knowledge card also
needs the embedding stack (`sentence-transformers` and `langchain-huggingface`, core dependencies of
`pip install -e .`, plus torch and numpy, which sentence-transformers pulls in) **and** the E5
weights already in the local Hugging Face cache. The embedder is constructed with
`local_files_only=True` so a request never triggers a download, which means the model has to be
fetched once, deliberately:

```bash
"$PY" -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('intfloat/multilingual-e5-base')"
```

Skip that and the endpoint answers `502 knowledge retrieval is temporarily unavailable`, which is
the retrieval stack missing rather than anything wrong with your API key.

**Tests that construct `MainSettings` must pass `_env_file=None`.** `MainSettings` sets
`env_file=".env"`, so on a machine with a real `.env` the file beats `monkeypatch.delenv`, a test
pinning defaults asserts that developer's values instead, and if the field is the API key pytest
prints the live secret in its assertion diff.

Never commit `.env` or API keys.

## Run

Start the whole stack:

```bash
bash scripts/run_local.sh
```

The script verifies CUDA, starts PostgreSQL, applies migrations, seeds taxonomy data, then launches
the CV service, the API, and the frontend. It prints the resolved URLs, the API base the frontend
will call, and the CORS allow-list, so a mismatch is visible before you open a browser. DINOv3 runs
on CUDA while multilingual E5 embeddings run on CPU.

Two preconditions are worth checking before blaming the code:

- `scripts/seed_taxonomy` reads `artifacts/Dataset/fishora_dataset/metadata/taxonomy.csv`. Without
  that file the species table stays empty, `GET /health` reports `taxonomy_seeded: false`, and every
  identification and manual declaration fails on species resolution.
- The CV service needs PyTorch. In an environment where torch is not installed it cannot start at
  all, so any flow that needs AI identification has to go through `POST /api/v1/fish/manual`
  instead. Verification, publication, bidding, and knowledge snapshots are unaffected.

### What the seed scripts do

The command sequence lives in [Quick start](#quick-start); this is what those three scripts are for.

`make_synthetic_taxonomy` stamps every row `synthetic-dev-fixture` and refuses to overwrite a file
that does not look synthetic, so restoring the real dataset later is safe. `seed_demo_lots` writes
`demo_`-prefixed rows only, attaches an illustrative knowledge card to each lot so the knowledge
panel and buyer matching have something to work on, and allocates one Nila lot to `buyer_dewi` so
the review flow is reachable.

`--reset` clears every lot first, including ones published by hand and the one the PRD walkthrough
publishes on each `playwright test` run. Without it a development database collects another
allocated Tenggiri every time the e2e suite runs.

None of these values are authoritative. Replace them with the real dataset before publishing any
claim about a species.

### Or start everything at once

```bash
FISHORA_FRONTEND_PORT=3111 bash scripts/run_local.sh
```

The script verifies CUDA, starts PostgreSQL, applies migrations, seeds taxonomy, then launches the
CV service, the API and the frontend, printing the resolved URLs, the API base compiled into the
browser bundle, and the CORS allow-list, so a mismatch is visible before you open a browser. It
needs the CV stack installed; use the manual sequence above if torch is missing.

Demo logins are `rian` / `demo` (operator) and `dewi` / `demo` (buyer).

Stop with `Ctrl+C`. All three processes are terminated; PostgreSQL stays up in Docker:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Running a subset

```bash
# Backend and CV only, no Node required
FISHORA_SKIP_FRONTEND=1 bash scripts/run_local.sh

# Frontend alone, against an API already running elsewhere
cd apps/frontend && pnpm dev
```

Run standalone, the frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000` for the API. Point it elsewhere with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, and remember to add that frontend's origin to
`FISHORA_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` on the API side.

### Avoiding port conflicts

Override any port; the derived URLs and CORS list follow:

```bash
FISHORA_FRONTEND_PORT=3111 FISHORA_MAIN_API_PORT=8080 bash scripts/run_local.sh
```

3000 is the script's default and 3111 is the port that is actually free on this machine, so passing
`FISHORA_FRONTEND_PORT=3111` is the normal case rather than the exception.

### Testing on a real phone

The dev server binds `0.0.0.0`, so a phone on the same network can open
`http://<your-machine-ip>:3111`. DESIGN.md treats mobile as the primary target, and layout at 390px
cannot be judged from a desktop browser. For the phone to reach the API, use your machine's address
on both sides:

```bash
FISHORA_FRONTEND_PORT=3111 \
FISHORA_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS="http://192.168.1.20:3111" \
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://192.168.1.20:8000" \
bash scripts/run_local.sh
```

## Verify the Services

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health                       # API: status and taxonomy_seeded
curl -fsS http://localhost:8001/health                       # CV service: status and model_version
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/openapi.json | head -c 200   # API is serving
```

`{"status":"ok","taxonomy_seeded":false}` means the API is healthy but unseeded. Fix the taxonomy
file before debugging anything downstream of species resolution.

Confirm the browser is actually allowed to call the API. An empty `access-control-allow-origin` here
is the cause of nearly every "the frontend cannot reach the backend" report:

```bash
curl -si -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8000/api/v1/fish/identify \
  -H 'Origin: http://localhost:3111' \
  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST' | grep -i access-control-allow-origin
```

The default allow-list (`DEFAULT_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` in `apps/main_api/config.py`) covers
`localhost` and `127.0.0.1` on both 3000 and 3111, with `allow_credentials=True` so the session
cookie survives the round trip.

Then open `http://localhost:3111`.

## Run Tests

> **The test suites are not tracked in git.** `tests/`, every `*.test.ts(x)`, `apps/frontend/e2e/`,
> `playwright.config.ts` and `vitest.config.ts` are gitignored, so a fresh clone has none of them and
> the commands below find nothing to run. They work on a checkout that already has them on disk.

Same `$PY` and `FISHORA_DATABASE_URL` as above.

### Backend

```bash
"$PY" -m pytest tests -q
```

Expect **300 passed, 4 failed, 6 skipped**. The four failures are all
`tests/main_api/test_embeddings.py` raising `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`: the torch
and sentence-transformers stack is not installed in this venv. They are environmental, not product
failures. Anything else failing is a real regression.

Subsets, when the database is not up:

```bash
"$PY" -m pytest -m "not integration and not real_artifact" -q
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/frontend
pnpm test     # Vitest: 35 files, 183 tests
pnpm lint     # 0 errors, 0 warnings
pnpm build    # type check plus production build
```

### End to end

Playwright drives a real browser against the running stack, so start the API and the frontend first.
Three viewport projects run: `phone` (Pixel 7), `phone-390` (the narrowest width DESIGN.md commits
to) and `desktop`.

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npx playwright test                      # 94 passed, 14 skipped
npx playwright test --project=phone-390  # the narrowest layout alone
```

The skips are honest: the PRD walkthrough runs on one project rather than three because it publishes
real rows, and the identification specs skip when the CV service is unreachable. `mvp.spec.ts` is
the eleven-step PRD 27 walkthrough and does exercise the live backend end to end.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| Browser console shows a CORS error | The frontend's origin is not in `FISHORA_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`. Run the OPTIONS check above. Changing `FISHORA_FRONTEND_PORT` without restarting the API is the usual cause |
| `pnpm not found`, backend starts anyway | Install pnpm, or keep going with `FISHORA_SKIP_FRONTEND=1` |
| `Frontend dependencies missing` | `cd apps/frontend && pnpm install` |
| `PyTorch is not installed in .venv` | The `cv` extra was never installed. The script prints the exact two commands to run |
| `cannot see a CUDA device` | Torch is installed without CUDA support. Reinstall from the cu128 index |
| `Missing .venv` | No virtualenv found at `.venv`. The script accepts both `bin/` (POSIX) and `Scripts/` (Windows) layouts |
| `/health` reports `taxonomy_seeded: false` | The species table is empty. `scripts/seed_taxonomy` needs `artifacts/Dataset/fishora_dataset/metadata/taxonomy.csv` |
| Identification returns 503 | The CV service is down or was never started (no torch). Use `POST /api/v1/fish/manual` to keep publishing |
| Knowledge card returns 502 | `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` is blank or OpenCode Go is unreachable. Identification and verification are unaffected |
| Knowledge card returns 409 | The prediction is still `pending`. Verify the species first |
| `EADDRINUSE` on startup | A previous run is still bound. Override the port, or stop the old process |
| Frontend loads but every request fails | Check the `API base` line the run script prints. It is compiled into the browser bundle, so it must be reachable *from the browser*, never an internal hostname |
